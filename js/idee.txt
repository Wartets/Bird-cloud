So I'd like you to tell me what to change/replace/modify/delete in my code to make these additions/modifications/corrections
Don't put any comments in the code But explain where to make the modifications outside the code, tell me what to delete/modify/add and where in the code
If a function is not changed, don't give it to me
Respect the indentation of my code
Give me the complete modified versions of the functions or elements (don't give me the Rendering, Simulation, etc constructors corrected in their entirety, give me their corrected modified sub-functions)
Give each modified functions or sub-functions separately, in the order of appearing in the code
I'd like you to give me the corrected elements again without deleting any existing functionality

I was wondering if it would be possible to make the code as practical as possible so that it would be easier to implement new features later Give me a list of suggestions Don't simplify my physics model or remove any features

Create a raw list without Markdown formatting, with many suggestions, and follow this format: (Just skip a line between two ideas)
'title
idea briefly described'
Do not code anything at all, do not generate code

I would like you to give me a very critical, raw list of all the problems you see on my page, covering all different aspects. Don't use Markdown; I want you to give me each element with a title followed by an explanation of the problem.

I don't want you to code here; I want you to write me a plan of how you're going to recode this so it works. There are a lot of sensitive things and features in my code, and I want to be sure you'll make the change correctly without breaking anything. Don't code anything, let's discuss. Use virtually no Markdown, and keep the style and layout extremely simple.
